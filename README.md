# Anomaly-Detection

Identify data points in data that don't fit the normal patterns by using 
GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, and Multinomial NB classifier

Explore the need of regularization and incorporate few relevant techniques for 
the problem statement

Compare models with and without regularization in a tabular format and 
do the prediction for the test data and display the results for the inference
